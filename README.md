# 🚀 AWS Learning Path - From Zero to Solutions Architect

Welcome to my AWS learning journey! This repository documents my progress as I build real-world projects to master AWS services and work towards becoming an AWS Solutions Architect.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a structured learning path with hands-on projects that progressively increase in complexity. Each project is fully documented with architecture diagrams, Infrastructure as Code, and detailed explanations.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master core AWS services through practical implementation
- Build production-ready architectures following AWS best practices
- Document the journey to help others learn
- Create a portfolio showcasing real AWS skills
- Prepare for AWS Solutions Architect certification
